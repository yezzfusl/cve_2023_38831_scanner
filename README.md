# CVE-2023-38831 Scanner

## Overview

The CVE-2023-38831 Scanner is an advanced cybersecurity tool designed to detect and analyze the presence of the CVE-2023-38831 vulnerability in WinRAR installations. This project implements a multi-layered approach to vulnerability detection, incorporating file integrity checks, process memory scanning, network traffic analysis, and sandbox execution.

## Features

- **Vulnerability Detection**: Scans WinRAR installations for the CVE-2023-38831 vulnerability.
- **File Integrity Checking**: Verifies the integrity of WinRAR executable files.
- **Process Memory Scanning**: Analyzes the memory of running WinRAR processes for suspicious patterns.
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Monitors network traffic for potential exploitation attempts.
- **Sandbox Execution**: Safely executes and analyzes WinRAR in a controlled environment.
- **Web Interface**: Provides a user-friendly web-based interface for initiating scans and viewing results.
- **Database Integration**: Stores and retrieves scan results for historical analysis.
- **Visualization**: Presents scan results through interactive charts and tables.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Scanner Module** (`src/scanner.py`): Orchestrates the scanning process, integrating all detection methods.
2. **Integrity Checker** (`src/integrity.py`): Implements file hash verification for WinRAR executables.
3. **Memory Scanner** (`src/memory_scanner.py`): Utilizes `psutil` for process memory analysis.
4. **Network Analyzer** (`src/network_analyzer.py`): Leverages `scapy` for network packet inspection.
5. **Sandbox Environment** (`src/sandbox.py`): Creates an isolated environment for safe execution and analysis.
6. **Database Handler** (`src/database.py`): Manages SQLite database operations for result storage and retrieval.
7. **Web Interface** (`src/web_interface.py`): Implements a Flask-based web server for user interaction.

### Key Technologies

- **Python 3.8+**: Core programming language
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for scan result storage
- **Flask**: Web framework for the user interface
- **Scapy**: Network packet manipulation and analysis
- **psutil**: Cross-platform process and system monitoring
- **Chart.js**: JavaScript library for result visualization

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    - `git clone https://github.com/yezzfusl/cve_2023_38831_scanner.git`
    - `cd cve_2023_38831_scanner`
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    - `python -m venv venv`
    - `source venv/bin/activate`  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install dependencies:
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set up the database:
    - `python -c "from src.database import Database; Database().create_table()"`

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

- Run the scanner from the command line:
    - `python -m src.cli`

### Web Interface

- Start the web server:
    - `python -m src.web_interface`

Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Configuration

- Database settings: Modify `src/database.py` to change the database file location or switch to a different database system.
- Scan parameters: Adjust threshold values and detection patterns in respective module files (e.g., `src/memory_scanner.py`, `src/network_analyzer.py`).

## Testing

- Run the test suite:
    - `pytest tests/`

## Security Considerations

- This tool should only be used on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
- The sandbox environment provides an additional layer of security, but caution should still be exercised when scanning potentially malicious files.
- Network traffic analysis may capture sensitive data. Ensure compliance with relevant privacy laws and regulations.

## Performance Optimization

- The memory scanner utilizes efficient memory mapping techniques to minimize resource usage.
- Database queries are optimized for performance, with proper indexing on frequently accessed columns.
- The web interface implements asynchronous scanning to prevent UI blocking during long-running scans.

## Extending the Project

- **Additional Vulnerability Checks**: Implement new detection methods in separate modules and integrate them into the `scanner.py` module.
- **API Development**: Extend the web interface to provide a RESTful API for integration with other security tools.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Incorporate ML models for anomaly detection in process behavior or network traffic patterns.
